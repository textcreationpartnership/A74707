            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, The Lord Doputie.</head>
            <p>SHewing that in all Ages paſt, ſince the happy ſubjection of this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> to the Imperiall Crown of <hi>England;</hi> it was and is a principall ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Princely care of his Majeſtie, and his moſt Noble Progenitors, Kings and Queenes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the vaſt expence of Treaſure and bloud, that their loyall and dutifull people of this Land of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being now for the moſt part derived from the <hi>Brittiſh Anceſtor,</hi> ſhould be governed according to the municipiall and fundamentall Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> that the ſtatute of <hi>Mugna Charta,</hi> or the great <hi>Charter</hi> for the liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and other lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lawes and ſtatutes, were in ſeverall Parliaments, here enacted and declared, that by the meanes thereof, and of the moſt prudent and benigne government
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119737:3"/>of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ſty</hi>, &amp; his royall Progenitors, this kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e was (untill of late) in its grouth to a flouriſhing eſtate, whereby the ſaid people were heretofore enabled to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their humble and naturall deſires, to comply with his Majeſties Royall and Princely occaſions, by the free gift of 150000. l. <hi>ſter.</hi> and likewiſe by another gift of 120000 l. <hi>ſter.</hi> more during the government of the <hi>Lord Viſcount Faulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and after by the gift of 40000. l. &amp; their free and cheerfull gift of 6. <hi>entire-ſibſidies,</hi> in the 10 yeare of his Majeſties Reign, which to comply with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties then occaſions ſignified to the then houſe of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons, they did allow ſhould amount in the collections unto 250000 l. although, as they confidently beleeve, if the ſaid ſubſidies had not bin leavied in a moderate parliamentary way, they would not have amounted to much more then halfe the ſaid ſum, beſides the foure entire ſubſidies, granted in this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So it is, may it pleaſe your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that by the occaſion of the enſuing and other grievances and innovations, though to his Majeſties no conſiderable profit, this Kingdome is reduced to that extreame and univerſall poverty, that the ſame is now leſſe able to pay 2 Subſidies, then it was heretofore to ſatiſfie all the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119737:3"/>before recited great paiments, &amp; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties moſt faithfull people of the ſame, doe conceive great feares that the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and conſequences thereof may hereafter bee drawne into precedents to be perpetuated upon their poſterity, which in their great hopes and ſtrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, they are perſwaded is contrary to his Majeſties Royall and Princely inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards his ſaid people, ſome of which ſaid grievances, are as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, the generall and apparent decay of Trades, occaſioned by the new and ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall rayſing of the booke of Rates and Jmpoſitions, as xij. d. a piece, cuſtome for Hides bought for 3.4. or 5. s. and many other heavie Impoſitions upon native &amp; other commodities exported and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by reaſon therof and of the extreame uſage, and cenſures, Marchants are begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and both diſinabled, and diſcouraged to trade; and ſome of the honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who gaine thereby are often Judges and parties, and that in Concluſion his Majeſties profit thereby is not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably advanced.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, the arbitrary deciſion of all civill cauſes and controverſies, by paper petitions before the Lord <hi>Lieutenant</hi> &amp;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119737:4"/>
               <hi>Lord Deputity,</hi> and infinit other judicators upon references from them derived in the nature of all actions, determinable at the common law, not limitted unto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine times, ſeaſons, cauſes, and things, whatſoever, and the conſequence of ſuch proceedings, by receiving immoderate &amp; unlawfull fees by <hi>Secretaries, Clerks, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivants, Serjeants</hi> at Arms, and otherwiſe by which kind of proceedings, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty loſeth a conſiderable part of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, upon originall writs, &amp; otherwiſe, and the ſubiect loſeth the benefit of his writ of errour, Bill of reverſall, vovchers, and other legall and juſt advantages, and the ordinary courſe and Courts of juſtice declined.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, the proceedings in civill cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at the Counſel boord, contrary to the law &amp; great <hi>Charter,</hi> and not limitted to any certaine time, or ſeaſon.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, that the ſubiect is in all the materiall parts therof denied the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the princely graces, and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of the ſtatute or Limitations, of the 21. <hi>Ian.</hi> granted by his Majeſtie in the 4. yeare of his Reigne, upon great advice of the Counſell of <hi>England and Ireland,</hi> and for great conſideration; and then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119737:4"/>in all the Courts of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in all the Courts of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in open Aſſizes, whereby all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doe take notice, that, contrary to his Majeſties pious intention, his Subjects of this Land have not enjoyed the benefit of his Majeſties Princely promiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Fiftly, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> extrajudiciall avoyding of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents of eſtates of a very great part of his Majeſties ſubjects under the great Seale (the publique faith of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) by private opinions delivered at Counſell Board, without legall Evicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their eſtates, contrary to the Law and without precedent or example of any former age.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Sixtly, the Proclamation for the ſole exemption and uttering of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> which is bought at very low Rates and uttered at high and exceſſive rates, by meanes whereof thouſands of Families within this Kingdome and of his Majeſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in ſeverall Iſlands and other parts of the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> (as your Petitioners are informed) are deſtroyed, and the moſt part of the Coyne of this Kingdome is ingroſſed into particular hands, Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that your Petitioners doe conceive
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119737:5"/>that the profit ariſing and ingroſſed thereby, doth ſurmount his Maieſties revenues Certaine and caſuall within this Kingdome, and yet his Maieſty receiveth but very little profit by the ſame.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Seaventhly, the unuſuall and unlawfull increaſing of <hi>Monopolies</hi> to the advantage of few, to the diſprofit of his Maieſtie and the impoveriſhment of his people.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Eightly, the extreame and cruell vſage of certaine late Commiſſioners and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, towards the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Farmers and Inhabitants of the City and Country of <hi>London-derry,</hi> by meanes whereof the worthy Plantation of that Country is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſtroyed, and the Inhabitants are reduced to great poverty and many of them forced to forſake the Country, the ſame being the firſt and moſt vſefull Plantation in the large Province of <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> to the great weakening of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in this time of danger, the ſaid Plantation being the principall ſtrength of thoſe parts.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Ninthly, the late erection of the Court of high Commiſſion for cauſes Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall in theſe neceſſitous times, the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119737:5"/>proceedings of the ſaid Court in many cauſes without legall warrant, and yet ſo ſupported as prohibitions have not been obtained, though legally ſought for, and the exceſſive fees exacted by the miniſters thereof, and the incroaching of the ſame vpon the Juriſdiction of other Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Courts of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Tenthly, the exorbitant and barbarous Fees and pretended Cuſtomes exacted by the Clergie againſt the Law, ſome of which have bin formerly repreſented to your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. Eleventhly, the Petitioners doe moſt heartily bemone that his Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and profits are much more impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then advanced by the grievances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid. And the Subſidies granted in the laſt Parliament having much encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Majeſties Revenue by the buying in of Grants and otherwiſe, and that all his Majeſties debts then due in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were ſatisfied out of the ſaid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies, and yet his Majeſtie is of late (as your Petitioners have been informed) in the houſe of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons become indebted in this Kingdome in great ſummes, and they doe therefore humbly beſeech that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119737:6"/>an exact account may be ſent to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, how and in what manner his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure iſſued.</p>
            <p n="7">XII. Twelfthly, the Petitioners doe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive great and juſt feares at a Proclamation publiſhed in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1635, prohibiting men of Quality or eſtate for to depart this Kingdome into <hi>England,</hi> without the Lord Deputies Licenſe, whereby the Subjects of this Kingdome are hindered and interrupted from free acceſſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe to his ſacred Maieſtie and Privy Counſell of <hi>England,</hi> to declare their juſt grievances, or to obtaine remedy for them, in ſuch ſort as their Anceſtors have done in all ages, ſince the Raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and great fees exacted for, every of the ſaid Licenſes.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Thirteenthly, that of late his Maieſties late Atturney generall hath exhibited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations againſt many ancient Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs of this Kingdome into his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties. Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> to ſhew by what warrant the ſaid Burroughes, who heretofore ſent Burgeſſes to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould ſend the ſaid Burgeſſes to the Parliament. And thereupon for want
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119737:6"/>of an anſwer, the ſaid Priviledge of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Burgeſſes was ſeized by the ſaid Court, which proceedings were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Coram non Judice,</hi> and contrary to the Lawes &amp; Priviledges of the houſe of Parliament (and if way ſhould be given thereunto) might tend to the ſubverſion of Parliaments, and by conſequence to the ruine &amp; deſtruction of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and that the houſe of Commons hath hitherto in this preſent Parliament bin deprived of the advice and Counſell of many profitable &amp; good members by meanes thereof.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Fourteenthly, that by the powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſome Miniſters of State in this Kingdome, the Parliament in its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and actions hath not his naturall freedome.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Fifteenthly, that the fees taken in all the Courts of Juſtice in this Kingdome, both Eccleſiaſticall and Civill and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferior Officers and Miniſters, are ſo immoderately high, that it is an unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keable burthen to all his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this, who are not able to ſubſiſt, except the ſame be ſpeedily remedied &amp; reduced to ſuch a moderation as may ſtand with the condition of this Realme.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:119737:7"/>
            <p> And laſtly, That the Gentry, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and other his Majeſties ſubjects of this Kingdome, are of late by the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and preſſures aforeſaid and other the like, very neere to Ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And Farmers of Cuſtomes, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers, Waiters, Searchers, Clearkes of unwarrantable proceedings, Purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Gaolers, and ſundry others ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much inriched, whereby and by the ſlow redreſſe of the Petitioners grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, his Majeſtes moſt faithfull and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull people of this Kingdome, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great feares that their readineſſe approved upon all occaſions, hath not beene of late rightly repreſented to his Majeſtie.</p>
